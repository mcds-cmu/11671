## Piazza
The best communication portal to inquire about coursework-related matters is **Piazza** (see the Overview for Piazza link). For urgent communication with the teaching staff, it is best to post on Piazza and then send an email for a timely response.

## Office Hours (OH)
**The teaching staff holds office hours** weekly to assist students with any course-related matters. Students can find the office hours schedule in the Google Calendar provided in the Overview. Before joining the Zoom meeting rooms, students must join the [OH Queue](https://www.eberly.cmu.edu/ohq/#/courses), as only those on the queue list will be invited to the meetings. Students attending office hours should join the OH queue, regardless of the queue's current status. Doing so allows TAs to better prepare for students' questions, helps maintain an orderly queue, and ensures students can track their place in line without concern.

## Designated TA / Extra-help OH
Students will be assigned a **designated TA** who will be their primary contact for course-related matters. It is important to note that students are not limited to attending only their designated TA's office hours; they are encouraged to interact with all course staff as needed.

Designated TAs also provide students with special **extra-help OH** if additional assistance is required. These extra-help sessions are separate from the regular office hours and follow a separate schedule. This offers students a valuable opportunity to receive extended support whenever needed.
