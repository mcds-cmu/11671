## OLI Torus

### Practice Quiz
Practice quizzes are non-graded retrieval practices to assess your understanding of the reading materials on OLI Torus. Completing the practice quizzes provides excellent signals on your weekly summative (graded) in-class quizzes.

You are strongly recommended to complete the practice quiz before the synchronous in-class quiz. If you missed many of the questions in the quiz, it is suggested that you review the material again.

### Weekly In-Class Quiz
Each week, during synchronous class meeting time, students will spend 10 minutes of class time completing the quiz. The quiz assesses the reading contents on OLI Torus the preceding week and is graded. When it is time to take the quiz, students log into OLI Torus to start. A timer will activate once the quiz starts and cannot be paused. The quiz will automatically stop after the time allowance. The student’s work will automatically be submitted and graded by the OLI Torus system.

Students will have only a single attempt to complete the weekly quiz on OLI Torus. 

## Sail()

This course includes seven individual project themes. Each project theme consists of several project modules. A project module must be completed based on the deadlines on Sail() Platform. The write-up required to complete each project module is available on Sail() Platform. Each module has a submission process that is specific to the project module that is due. It is the student's responsibility to ensure all project work is completed and the project module is submitted before the deadline. Students typically have multiple attempts to submit the project module on Sail() Platform.

## Online Programming Exercise (OPE)

On the Sail() Platform, you will also see two OPE (Online Programming Exercise) activities: a practice OPE and an OPE after Project 3. These are synchronous team-based exercises to expand your knowledge on the topics of the preceding projects. Each OPE is associated with a project and accounts for 5% of that project's grade. The first OPE, "OPE: Practice," is ungraded.

## Manual-graded Components
In Project 3 and the final exam, some components are manually graded questions. Students must submit a pdf or images of their work on Gradescope for manual grading. It is crucial for students to meticulously follow the submission guidelines on Gradescope, ensuring that each image or page of their write-up is accurately associated with the relevant question. Any deviation from this process, leading to an unlinked or incorrectly linked submission, will be treated as an invalid response and will automatically receive a grade of zero.

## Midterm Exam
A midterm exam will be administered during class time, adhering to the schedule outlined in the course calendar. This exam encompasses both programming and conceptual components, covering all learning objectives taught from the start of the semester up until the midterm. Students are strongly encouraged to thoroughly review all materials from Sail() and Torus in preparation for the exam.

The submission of the midterm exam will take place on Sail(). Each exam will be subject to manual grading to ensure comprehensive and fair assessment. This exam is a crucial part of the course, designed to evaluate the depth of students' understanding and their ability to apply the concepts learned in the first half of the semester.

## Final Exam
The final exam consists of three parts: the coding component, the write-up, and the conceptual quiz. Each of these is designed to assess different skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course.

### Coding Component on Sail() (30 points):

    - Similar to the format of the seven prior projects, students will work on the coding component using Sail().
    - There is no limit on the number of submissions, but the final grade for this component is based on the most recent submission, not the highest score.
    - The autograder on Sail() will not run your notebook code; it will only grade the model deployment part by sending POST requests to your endpoint, with a runtime limit of 70 seconds.
    - Students can use Azure ML Studio exclusively for model deployment, while other steps can be completed in any chosen environment.
    - After submission, students can check their model's accuracy and their score on the "My Submissions" tab in Sail().

### Write-up Component on Gradescope (40 points):

    - A set of write-up questions is included at the end of the coding component notebook.
    - Students should type their responses directly in the notebook and submit a PDF or images of their work to Gradescope for manual grading.
    - Students must adhere strictly to the Gradescope instructions to guarantee that their submitted images or pages are correctly linked to the designated question in their write-up. Failure to properly link work to the corresponding question will result in a zero grade, as our system will categorize it as an invalid response.
    - Submissions can be made any number of times before the final exam deadline on Gradescope, with the final grade based on the latest submission.
    - A grace period of 12 hours is available on Gradescope, but submissions in this period will incur a 20% grade penalty. Submissions after this grace period will not be accepted.
    - It's important to note that the Sail() submissions will not be checked for the write-up; only submissions to Gradescope will be considered for grading.

### Conceptual Component on OLI Torus (30 points):

    - This comprehensive quiz covers all course modules and must be completed during class time as per the schedule found in the course calendar.
    - The quiz comprises 15 questions with a 30-minute time limit and is independent of the coding and write-up components.
    - All components of the final exam must be completed within the designated final exam period, and no extensions will be granted. This structure ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the skills and knowledge acquired in the course.

## End-of-course Survey
An end-of-course survey will be distributed around the final exam week. The survey aims to gather constructive feedback from students for further improvement and development of the course. To thank you for your time, students will be awarded 2% of the overall course grade for survey completion.
