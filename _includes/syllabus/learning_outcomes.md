### Conceptual Learning Objectives

The conceptual learning objectives are below. Students will be able to:

1. Describe the phases of the data science project lifecycle and articulate the interaction between them to inform the development of analytic solutions.

2. Formulate analytic objectives to produce actionable business/scientific insights from data and then formulate functional and non-functional requirements for an envisioned data-driven solution to a business/research problem.

3. Examine and describe the formal characteristics of the data collection process. Apply the fundamental concepts in the data collection process to a dataset for analysis by machine learning methods.

4. Compare and contrast different techniques of representing the domain as feature vectors; explore how different featurization of a dataset influence trained model performance and task utility.

5. Explain different analysis techniques using the same linear/logistic regression model at its core (“gatekeeper” task) and interpret domain problems as instances of data science task patterns, including classification, regression, ranking, and clustering.

6. Explain basic principles of how the bias-variance tradeoff affects model choice and configuration, and then describe how information available for domain problems can become a dataset on which models can be trained.

7. Identify ways to improve the representation, model, and/or experiment towards the analytic objective and explain quantitative evaluation metrics for various data science task patterns.
