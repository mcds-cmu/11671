The programming projects are geared towards providing hands-on experience with the following topics:


### Project 1: Data Structure Selection and Optimization for Large Data Sets

The growth of the home-sharing and short-term rental markets have presented opportunities and challenges for communities globally. While for some, it encourages tourism and provides additional income streams, for others, it exacerbates the shortage of affordable housing. Your goal is to create a website that computes and shares the relevant analyzing results by scraping a data set from the Airbnb website and implementing a helper website that provides a responsive, user-friendly interface that computes analytic results on the fly. In this project, you will get hands-on experience with different data types and data structures and will make decisions on which data structure to apply by analyzing the performance differences caused by different approaches. You will explore different caching strategies and understand time differences in read/write operations from and to different data storage implementations.

### Project 2: Problem Representation

Product review is a rich source of data for any business and can be used to improve customer experience, for example, by recommending new products that cater to the customer's preference (think Amazon or Netflix). In this project, students will use a dataset of product review ratings to implement a simple recommender system using the collaborative filtering approach. The project will help students understand different representations of the collaborative filtering problem as well as the runtime and storage tradeoff in each representation.

### Project 3: Domain Analysis and Exploration

Exploratory data analysis and visualization is a critical step to analyzing data, understanding feature correlations, and ultimately preparing the data for predictive modeling. In this project, students will utilize the Climate Change and Food Production dataset to preprocess data and generate visuals such as bar charts, heatmaps, and time series analysis graphs. By merging two different data sets, students can visually observe how climate change has influenced food production over the years. This project will help with understanding how to preprocess data and generate meaningful visuals to draw inferences.

### Project 4: Domain Data Preparation 

Advances in the internet and in search engines have provided us with unparalleled access to data; with a simple search query, you can acquire countless data points from several sources, including social media, news articles, and even research papers. An experienced data scientist should be able to build their own dataset on any given topic by performing the necessary data collection and processing tasks. This project will introduce students to a variety of toolkits for retrieving text data and for transforming them into a format suitable for numerical computations.
