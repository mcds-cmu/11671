## Projects

The programming projects are geared towards providing hands-on experience with the following topics:


### Project 1: Data Structure Selection and Optimization for Large Data Sets

The growth of the home-sharing and short-term rental markets have presented opportunities and challenges for communities globally. While for some, it encourages tourism and provides additional income streams, for others, it exacerbates the shortage of affordable housing. Your goal is to create a website that computes and shares the relevant analyzing results by scraping a data set from the Airbnb website and implementing a helper website that provides a responsive, user-friendly interface that computes analytic results on the fly. In this project, you will get hands-on experience with different data types and data structures and will make decisions on which data structure to apply by analyzing the performance differences caused by different approaches. You will explore different caching strategies and understand time differences in read/write operations from and to different data storage implementations.

### Project 2: Problem Representation

Product review is a rich source of data for any business and can be used to improve customer experience, for example, by recommending new products that cater to the customer's preference (think Amazon or Netflix). In this project, students will use a dataset of product review ratings to implement a simple recommender system using the collaborative filtering approach. The project will help students understand different representations of the collaborative filtering problem as well as the runtime and storage tradeoff in each representation.

### Project 3: Domain Analysis and Exploration

Exploratory data analysis and visualization is a critical step to analyzing data, understanding feature correlations, and ultimately preparing the data for predictive modeling. In this project, students will utilize the Climate Change and Food Production dataset to preprocess data and generate visuals such as bar charts, heatmaps, and time series analysis graphs. By merging two different data sets, students can visually observe how climate change has influenced food production over the years. This project will help with understanding how to preprocess data and generate meaningful visuals to draw inferences.

### Project 4: Domain Data Preparation 

Advances in the internet and in search engines have provided us with unparalleled access to data; with a simple search query, you can acquire countless data points from several sources, including social media, news articles, and even research papers. An experienced data scientist should be able to build their own dataset on any given topic by performing the necessary data collection and processing tasks. This project will introduce students to a variety of toolkits for retrieving text data and for transforming them into a format suitable for numerical computations.

### Project 5: Machine Learning and Model Performance

Machine learning has become a very popular field in recent years due to its transformative applications coupled with the availability of good datasets in various domains. A large number of machine learning libraries and tutorials have also greatly reduced the entrance barriers to the field. On the other hand, one still needs a solid understanding of the underlying data and mathematics principles to properly utilize existing machine learning tools. For example, machine learning methods typically work best when the hyperparameters are tuned based on the dataset at hand, yet care must also be taken to preserve the boundary between training and testing data. This project will provide students with hands-on experience in some of these areas.

### Project 6: Model Deployment and Comparison

Deep learning has transformed many modern technologies, from language translation to self-driving cars. At the same time, the abundance of deep learning libraries and frameworks now allows us to become not just users but also developers of deep learning applications. This project will provide you with hands-on experience in building and deploying convolutional network models in a practical setting, using PyTorch and Azure cloud resources.

### Project 7: Evaluation Optimization

One of the major phases of any machine learning pipeline is the evaluation and optimization of models based on the results of successive evaluations. In this project, you will use the SQuAD dataset to build a question answering system, utilizing various techniques for data preprocessing and question answering tasks while understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. This project will help you understand the various perspectives on how to optimize solutions in machine learning as you apply different techniques, as well as the caveats for each technique you consider.
